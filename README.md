# Analysis Of Mumbai City To Estimate Some Optimal Locations for A New Italian Restaurant

## 1. Background

Mumbai (previously known as Bombay until 1996) is a natural harbor on the west coast of
India, and is the capital city of Maharashtra state. It is India's largest city, and one of the
world's most populous cities. It is the financial capital of India and is a global city, known for
being the home to one of the highest number of billionaires as well as having huge global
influence. The city is the 9th most populous in the world. It has approximately 20 million
people. Along with the neighboring cities of Navi Mumbai and Thane, it forms the world's
4th largest urban agglomeration.

## 1. Business Problem

As you can see from the figures, Mumbai is a city with a high population, In this project we
will try to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted
to stakeholders interested in opening an Italian restaurant in Mumbai, India.
Since there are lots of restaurants in Mumbai we will try to detect locations that are not
already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Italian
restaurants in vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to city.

We will generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on this criteria.
